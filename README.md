A simple machine learning project demonstrating how to build, train, and evaluate a **Logistic Regression** model for classification tasks.  
This repository is designed to help beginners understand the basics of **supervised learning** and how classification works in practice.

---

## 📖 Overview

Logistic Regression is one of the simplest yet powerful algorithms for **binary classification** problems.  
It works by estimating probabilities using the **sigmoid function** and classifying inputs into categories (e.g., *yes/no*, *spam/not spam*, *0/1*).

---

## 🧮 How Logistic Regression Works

Unlike **linear regression**, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts **probabilities** that an instance belongs to a certain class.

### 1. Linear Combination  
We first compute a weighted sum of features:

\[
z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n
\]

where:  
- \( w \) = model weights (learned during training)  
- \( x \) = input features  

---

### 2. Sigmoid Activation  
To convert \( z \) into a probability between 0 and 1, we apply the **sigmoid function**:

\[
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]

This gives us:

- Values close to **0** → class 0  
- Values close to **1** → class 1  

📈 *Example sigmoid curve:*

---

### 3. Decision Boundary  
We classify based on a threshold (usually 0.5):

\[
\hat{y} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sigma(z) \geq 0.5 \\
0 & \text{if } \sigma(z) < 0.5
\end{cases}
\]

This creates a **decision boundary** in the feature space.
